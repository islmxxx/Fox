# StartimesUsers

This little Python script returns all current users of Startimes.com (Forum.kooora.com as well), the users number at the moment of creating this is : **22 596** <br />
It can be used for many purposes (the dataset is including the id of the members as well, which I consider not wise to expose to the public) <br />
**Usage:** <br />
`> Python getusers.py [nbr_of_pages] [output_file] [flag_show_console]`   <br />
*-within the files the current list of Startimes users.* <br />
*Python version : 3.*
